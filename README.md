# ASSIGNMENT-2

From Student:

I added the missing imports for BufferedWriter and FileWriter and IOException that are required for the code to work.

The class name in the code is SensorDataProcessor, but the constructor name is DataProcessor so i changed it to SensorDataProcessor to match the class name.
